    <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        I don't know how to write this without sounding to privileged. But every holiday that includes gift giving, family asks me and my girlfriend: "What do you want for *insert holiday here*", and we answer in unison "I don't know üòÖ". But in fact, we do know, but we don't remember it.

        So I created this app. I also wanted to play around with SwiftUI, so that came as a bonus. But, back to what I was talking about. Wishywashy is a app for your wishlist, and it provides you with a way to share said list. That is! Nothing fancy, but it solves our problem üòÅ Now my family knows what I want/need for birthdays and/or holidays
